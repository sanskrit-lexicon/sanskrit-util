# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-14

Initial extraction. Consolidates the Sanskrit string helpers that were duplicated across the
CDSL / Sanskrit-Lexicon repos into one Python + JS package.

- **Python**: `to_slp1`, `from_slp1`, `to_roman`, `form_key`, `norm`, `nfold` extracted
  verbatim from `WhitneyRoots/scripts/sanskrit_util.py` and regression-locked against that
  donor (`tools/gen_vectors.py` fails if they ever diverge).
- **JS-origin helpers** folded in from WhitneyRoots `reader.js` (`deva_to_iast`) and
  `src/utils/linguistics.js` (`iast_to_devanagari`, `normalize_sanskrit`).
- **JS port** (`js/index.mjs`) is behaviour-identical to Python; 346 shared golden vectors
  assert `JS == Python` in CI.
- **One intentional unification:** `norm()` is now Devanāgarī-aware in **both** languages
  (it transliterates Devanāgarī via `deva_to_iast` before folding). The original Python
  `norm()` was IAST-only; the original JS `norm()` already did this. For IAST input the
  behaviour is unchanged (the donor regression confirms it), so existing Python consumers are
  unaffected; Devanāgarī input now yields IAST keys instead of raw Devanāgarī.
- `normalize_sanskrit` is kept **distinct** from `norm` (it is the lossy ASCII-folding
  v3-explorer key) rather than silently merged — they had different semantics in the donor.

### First consumer
`WhitneyRoots/scripts/sanskrit_util.py` is now a thin re-export shim pointing at this package;
its six importing scripts are unchanged.

### Not consolidated (deliberately)
- Dhaval Patel's `transcoder.py` (the 62-copy Cologne engine) — that is the dictionary-build
  toolchain's own vendored dependency; reuse it from `csl-pywork`, don't fold it here.
- `scripts/dcs/` Roman↔Arabic + fold helpers in WhitneyRoots — a separate corpus-class
  pipeline, intentionally kept apart upstream.
